                            <p>
                                I love building tools that
                                are {markWord("user-friendly,", "#E8F5E9")} {markWord("simple", "#E3F2FD")} and {markWord("minimalistic.", "#FFEBEE")}
                                <br/>
                                During my studies I learned the basics
                                of {markWord("front-end", "#E8F5E9")} and {markWord("back-end web development.", "#FFEBEE")} Currently
                                I'm dedicated to {markWord("learn React", "#E3F2FD")} to take
                                my web development skills to the next level. For this reason, I am currently working
                                very intensively with React privately and building up a portfolio in parallel.
                                <br/><br/>
                                Through my {markWord("work experiences", "#E3F2FD")} in the
                                last {markWord("four years", "#E8F5E9")}, I
                                had the opportunity to work with cross-functional teams and different
                                technologies. Although {markWord("back-end development", "#FFEBEE")} has
                                been my {markWord("main area", "#FFEBEE")} over the past time, I wanted
                                to {markWord("expand my skills", "#E8F5E9")} in the
                                {markWord("front-end development.", "#E8F5E9")} This versatility allows
                                me to work effectively at different stages of a project's development and ensure
                                that the final products are both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
